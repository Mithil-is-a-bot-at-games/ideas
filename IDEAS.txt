Ideas:
voice changer
weather notification app?
project archive
collision sim


Elaboration:
Voice Changer: Test will be input into a text box. Computer will then take that text and turn it inot speech. Filters can also be used to make the experience more fun
(i.e alien, radio, distorted, echo, etc)

Weather App: Put information about area code into app. Will take information about weather report about that day and push it into the lock screen on IOS and Android. 
This short weather summary will include things about the Lows, Highs, whether it is going to be sunny,cloudy,partly cloudy, rainy, snowy, or storming. By navigating
into the app, one can find a much more more detailed description about what will be happening that day. This notification will be sent out at any time to the users' liking
